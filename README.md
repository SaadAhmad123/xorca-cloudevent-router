# xOrca CloudEvent Router

This package is meticulously crafted with a focus on seamless integration with the [xOrca orchestration engine](https://github.com/SaadAhmad123/xOrca). While originally tailored for the xOrca ecosystem, this versatile package stands independently, allowing you to construct robust CloudEvent-based services. It remains agnostic to any specific runtime environment, ensuring compatibility across platforms with a NodeJS executor.

In the context of xOrca, this router serves as a fundamental component for the [microservices fleet](https://github.com/SaadAhmad123/xOrca?tab=readme-ov-file#concepts), orchestrating their interactions under the guidance of the xOrca orchestrator.
